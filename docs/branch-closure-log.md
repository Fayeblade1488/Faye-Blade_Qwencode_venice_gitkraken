## Summary

Both Copilot branches contained the same problematic change to `venice_integration.py` line 929, where they attempted to pass an `api_key` argument to `update_raycast_config()` which doesn't accept any parameters. The correct fix was implemented in our comprehensive work, changing line 963 from `if args.update_config:` to `elif args.update_config:` to make the command-line options mutually exclusive.

The branches have been archived for traceability and will be deleted from the remote repository to keep the branch list clean and avoid confusion.
